# Description
A mod using Artificial Beings Framework (ABF) and Synstructs Core (ABF:SC) to bring civilian synstructs to RimWorld. Synstructs have long been integrated into human societies, long ago first created as experiments into a new kind of citizenry. Their creators were surprised by how enthusiastically the infantile intelligences were to embrace humanity. Synstructs are not and never will be common in society, but civil synstructs are neither exotic nor unwelcome in most sufficiently advanced civilizations.


## Features
* Four races of humanlike-intelligence synstruct models for production:
    * The commoner, the most ubiquitous and general purpose model. Commoners can be drones, reprogrammable drones, or sapient, and are very similar to baseline humans in the sense of being somewhat unremarkable.
    * The simpleton, the cheapest and least complex model. Simpletons can be drones, reprogrammable drones, or sapient, and are generally reviled by all who witness them for the sheer disgrace of their existence. Sapient simpletons tend to be loathed and loathe everyone else. What they lack in resilience and grace, they make up for in speed and cost.
    * The stoic, a rugged and stalwart model. Stoics can only be sapient, and are much more resilient mentally than their peers. They also recover from sustained damage quicker. They are slower than other models, though.
    * The socialite, a versatile model. Socialites can only be sapient, and learn faster and communicate better than their peers. They're otherwise somewhat unremarkable.
* Research and recipes to unlock and manufacture the models.
* A simple starting scenario for players to start. It's the crashlanded scenario, but with synstructs, effectively.

## Known Issues/Incompatibilities
* Issues may be out there, but none are known at the moment.
